# Smart-Lock
It is a smart locking door that is designed to unlock a door when receiving 
instructions from an authorized device using RFID cards/tags or using a keypad. Instead of 
the traditional way which is using a door key, our smart locking door provides the users 
convenient ways while they have the same level of security as traditional locks. When the 
user tapped the authorized cards or inputted the correct password, our system would open 
up the door and close the door for the user immediately once they entered the apartment. In 
case there is no one passing through, it still closes the door automatically. When the access 
way is unauthorized, the system will capture a photo for further investigation and send an 
email/SMS if there are too many attempts. All the access records are uploaded to the server 
eventually for the user to check. We also provided a mobile application to modify the 
permission of the RFID cards/tags.
